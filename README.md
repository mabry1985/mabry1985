# Josh Mabry

I enjoy exploring the intersection of AI and UX — combining fullstack engineering, design thinking, and AI research to build products that make complex technology accessible and empowering.

## Recent Work

**Rabbit Hole** — Real-time collaborative knowledge graph platform  
Built sync infrastructure (Yjs CRDT, <100ms latency), integrated LangGraph agents for automated research, and designed tier system handling Free through Enterprise users.

Stack: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node, Neo4j, PostgreSQL

**Deep Agent Researcher** — Multi-agent knowledge extraction system  
Supervisor coordinates 6 specialized agents using LangGraph for autonomous research workflows. Produces validated knowledge graph bundles with evidence citations and confidence scores.

Stack: LangGraph, TypeScript, Python

**AI Playground System** — Interactive capability testing framework  
Reusable component pattern for validating AI features before full implementation. Built 12 playgrounds for LLM providers, transcription, and agent workflows. Enables non-technical stakeholders to test directly.

Stack: React Query, TypeScript, Storybook

### Other Projects
- [**acai.so**](https://github.com/artificialcitizens/acai.so) — AI-powered markdown editor with agentic workflows and local model support  
- [**AC-Scripts**](https://github.com/artificialcitizens/ac-scripts) — Open-source AI scripts for developer productivity (ScriptKit ecosystem)  
- [**Chat Your Knowledgebase**](https://www.knapsack.cloud/blog/how-to-chat-with-your-knowledge-base) — Primer on building RAG pipelines with LLMs & embeddings  

## Technical Background

**Frontend:** React, Next.js 15, component libraries, design systems, accessibility, performance optimization

**Backend:** Node.js, Python, API design, WebSockets, Docker, monorepo architecture

**Data:** PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Redis, vector databases, S3

**AI/ML:** LangChain, LangGraph, prompt engineering, RAG pipelines, tool orchestration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq)

**Infrastructure:** Real-time collaboration (Yjs CRDT), CI/CD, testing (Vitest, Cypress), observability

## Approach

I believe AI should augment developer creativity, not replace it. My focus is on building tools that enhance productivity while keeping safety, transparency, and maintainability at the core. _Learn by shipping, measure what matters, iterate._
