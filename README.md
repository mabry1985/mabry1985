# 👋 Hi, I’m Josh Mabry  

I’m a **fullstack developer and AI engineer** building developer tools, design systems, and AI-powered applications. My work sits at the intersection of **UX engineering** and **AI orchestration**, with a focus on making complex systems **safe, reliable, and accessible**.  

---

## 🔧 What I Work On  
- **AI Systems**: RAG pipelines, prompt engineering, tool-use orchestration (LangChain, Pinecone, Python, TypeScript)  
- **Developer Tools**: CI/CD pipelines, test automation (Cypress, Jest), IDE/CLI utilities, scalable design systems  
- **Frontend Engineering**: React (hooks, context, suspense), accessibility audits, performance optimization  
- **Backend & Infra**: Node.js, Postgres, containerized environments, API design, DevOps workflows

## 🚀 Featured Projects  
- [**acai.so**](https://github.com/artificialcitizens/acai.so) — AI-powered markdown editor with agentic workflows and local model support  
- [**AC-Scripts**](https://github.com/artificialcitizens/ac-scripts) — Open-source AI scripts for developer productivity (ScriptKit ecosystem)  
- [**Chat Your Knowledgebase**](https://www.knapsack.cloud/blog/how-to-chat-with-your-knowledge-base) — Primer on building RAG pipelines with LLMs & embeddings  

---

## 📖 What Drives Me  
I believe AI should **augment developer creativity, not replace it**. My focus is on building tools that enhance productivity while keeping **safety, transparency, and maintainability** at the core.  

---

## 🛠️ Current Stack  
**Languages & Frameworks**: TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python, Svelte, Ruby on Rails (legacy work)  
**AI/ML**: LangChain, Pinecone, embeddings, orchestration & evals, Claude for coding workflows  
**Infra & Tooling**: Docker, Cypress, Jest, GitHub Actions, Postgres, Terraform (basics)
